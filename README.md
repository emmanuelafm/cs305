**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

My client was Artemis Financial, an international finance company. The client wanted a program written for a mobile application that will support tasks, contacts, and appointments. Each of them has add/update/delete features.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

I did well at understanding what a vulnerability can mean for a program and the larger system. It is important to code securely because even one seemingly minor vulnerability could offer a free path for malicious parties to get into the system. 

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

The most challenging part was working with existing code that was not explained in much depth beforehand. However, using the resources such as readings and content from Java and Oracle's websites helped guide me along. 

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

I increased layers of security by switching to HTTPS protocol, making sure the API interactions were effective and secure, manually checking the code, and running dependency checks multiple times. 

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I ran dependency checks before and after refactoring my code to see how the vulnerabilities changed. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I used resources such as the class readings and content from Java and Oracle's websites. 

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would show the main class where I used MessageDigest to implement SHA-256 and then programmed it to display on a local host page.
